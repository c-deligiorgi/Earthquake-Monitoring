# Earthquake-Monitoring
Earthquakes can have devastating effects when they occur, and although it is known that they are more likely to occur in some places than in others they are almost impossible to predict. In order to help scientists understand earthquakes better, an international monitoring system is in place to record where earthquakes occur and how powerful they are. Earthquake strength is measured by the ‘magnitude moment’: earthquakes of magnitude three or lower usually imperceptible but those with magnitude seven and over can cause serious damage over large areas. National seismological observatories record earthquakes that occur, although different observatories were set up at different times, so the period over which historical data is available varies from place to place.
